# The class project

The class project will be something akin to a start-up company of your own
design and choosing. Students will assemble into teams of two or three people and
select the project on which they would like to work. This project should base
in the consumer web space: it should not be a business-to-business idea. Instead,
it should be made for consumers and, ideally, large numbers of consumers. The
project should be plausibly sustainable in the sense that you could craft around
it a business model that would lead to profitability. You may, and are encouraged
to, develop business models that benefit society in some fashion, particularly
through the creation of externalities that your business model does not capture.

Throughout the second half of the semester,
you will submit weekly updates describing the progress of the venture. These
updates will include narrative and metrics relating to the development of your
software project, understanding customer needs, and your evolving business
model. Teams will be frequently asked to speak about their projects during class.

The class project is not graded all-at-once. Instead, the grade is divided into
separate assignments. Each week, your team will submit a short update. We will provide
a format for those updates when the time is right. All updates will be hosted
on a [small blog application](https://git.yale.edu/cpsc-113-spring-2016/blog-starter)
that we created for CPSC113. Most updates will have standardized components including

* news and "learnings" from the previous week;
* a [business model canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas);
* records of customer interviews;
* metrics of traction;
* technical updates (challenges, decisions, plans); and,
* goals for the upcoming week.

These updates will *usually* be graded with equal weighting to the following components:

* venture progress (experiments performed, "learnings", traction, etc);
* goals (both goals articulated and progress against goals previously set);
* code quality (architecture, clarity, efficiency, security, other best practices);
* application user experience; and,
* incorporation of prior instructor feedback.

That grading *will change over the course of the semester*. For example, some
updates will have partiular mandates, like the "MVP spec" update, which will
require a specification for the "minimum viable product" to be built in the
semester. Also, each team will have different needs: some will require work
on their front end, others more customer interviews, still others advanced
analytics to track user conversions. As the semester progresses,
grading will become more bespoke as teams are asked to focus on particular
aspects of their project and incorporate feedback.
