- You'll need git installed if you don't already have it.
- If you're on a Windows machine, the grading code likely won't run on your machine. Swing by office hours and we'll get you set up with a virtual environment.
- The grading code will be happier if you create a project folder first and download the grading code and clone the git repo into that folder -- structure will end up looking like this:
cli-assignment
  - cpsc213hw1
  - movie-data
  - assignment_cli-and-git-jacobbendicksen
    - README.md
    - situation.txt
    - movies
        - movie-goers.txt
        - ...other files
- Don't create another submission folder within the git repo -- use the repo for that.
- The elixir-jose question is actually looking for 7-letter hashes, not 6-letter hashes.
- Some grading code links are broken, try these if it's not working for you:
  - Mac: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kljensen/public/cpsc213hw1/mac/cpsc213hw1
  - Linux: https://s3.amazonaws.com/kljensen/public/cpsc213hw1/linux/cpsc213hw1
- The video mentions needing to fill out your class profile to tell us your
  GitHub username. You don't need to do this. When you submit the assignment,
  we'll know where you repo is.
- We created a new version of the grading code and eliminated two tests. You
  can download the code for your platform here:
