- You'll need git installed if you don't already have it.
- If you're on a Windows machine, the grading code likely won't run on your machine. Swing by office hours and we'll get you set up with a virtual environment.
- The grading code will be happier if you create a project folder first and download the grading code and clone the git repo into that folder -- structure will end up looking like this:
cli-assignment
  - cpsc213hw1
  - movie-data
  - assignment_cli-and-git-jacobbendicksen
    - README.md
    - situation.txt
    - movies
        - movie-goers.txt
        - ...other files
- Don't create another submission folder within the git repo -- use the repo for that.
- The elixir-jose question is actually looking for 7-letter hashes, not 6-letter hashes.
