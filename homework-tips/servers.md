- Don't forget to `npm install --save` the packages you're using
- The Express/Hapi/Koa documentation is your friend. I wrote my app in Express, and if you're doing the same, look at the documentation for GET routes.
- Heroku/DigitalOcean/GCP look scary, but they're really just Git remotes.
- For the second test, you need to send a message along with your status code.
In my experience, that's probably why the grading code is hanging.
