- How to visualize a SQL database:
	- The entire database is an Excel spreadsheet
	- Individual tables are sheets within the spreadsheet
	- Each table (i.e. sheet) can have its own fields (column names), and you can also have cross-table references

- Useful commands for exploring your SQL database:
	- `.exit` - quits the interactive shell
	- `.schema` - shows the schema for the database's tables
	- `.tables` - lists the tables in the database
