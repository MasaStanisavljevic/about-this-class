# Overview

This course introduces Yale students to the computer science and
entrepreneurship knowledge used in the construction of consumer web
start-ups. The computer science concepts we will cover include data
storage, networking, client-server architectures, mobile computing,
and security. The entrepreneurship concepts include evidence-based
entrepreneurship (or "the Lean Startup"), customer acquisition, app
analytics, as well as law and finance as they apply to entrepreneurship.
This course is "flipped" in the sense that class members complete
both readings and a quiz prior to each class, such that in class
our time may be spent on activities and discussion. The principal
deliverables in the course are a series of web applications developed
independently by each student, and a semester long project completed
in teams. Each team's class project
will be a consumer web application. With rare exception these will
be mobile-first and have some kind of social component. These apps
will be build using a modern web stack, the particular components
of which (database, server language, client frameworks) are at the
discretion of each class member or team to decide for themselves.
